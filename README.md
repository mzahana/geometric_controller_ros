# px4_geometric_controller
A ROS2 package that provides implementation of a geometric controller, SE(3).
The implementation of the SE(3) controller is general in the sense it is not implemented for a particular interface such as MAVROS. 
For particular interface, a separate ROS 2 node is used. A MAVROS insterface is currently supported to be used with a PX4 autopilot.
